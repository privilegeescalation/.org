Pedro grew up in a small town in Portugal. The type of town/environment where anyone doing something outside of the "norm" was a scandal talked about for years to come. Early on, he suffered from anxiety and depression, self-medicating for years. 

Only after support from his spouse, Heather, that Pedro worked on himself.

Now Pedro wants to pay forward for the help he got. He believes people should support each other in being themselves with no judgment nor prejudice.
