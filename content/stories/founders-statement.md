I have been recovering from facial feminization surgery for 2 weeks and have spent my time incorporating The Privilege Escalation Foundation in California, and filing our Founding Bylaws with the IRS.

I have one simple mission.

After spending the majority of my career with other Non-Profit 501(c)(3) organizations there are a few things I knew I wanted to do.

The more I thought about what was important to me as a transgender person, the more I realized how passionate I was about the bylaws and posture of the organization. 

So I want to publicly announce a few things right away just to set the tone of things.

### 1. Our ledger will always be 100% transparent

Upon founding, I donated a mere $1,000.00 to the foundation. 

We have already spent $499.95 of that on registering a trademark, filing fees, and hosting this website.

As of June 1st, we have $500.05 in operating capital.

We plan on sharing our ledger on the website and in GitHub as soon as we can automate it. In the mean time we will [tweet](https://twitter.com/setuid_org) about it.

### 2. Those who control the money are not those who spend the money

Our money is managed by "The Board of Directors" -- who currently is just me.

Our money is then awarded by a majority vote of our [members](/members) -- who currently is **not** me.

The Board of Directors (_again -- me_) can elect **members**.

Membership can also be awarded by a majority vote of **members**.

### 3. My compensation will always be $0.00

On day one I decided two things.

 - I will pay myself $0.00
 - All compensation will be pre-determined and non-negotiable for every other position at the foundation

I am technically eligible for a sponsorship from the foundation, but I certainly do not ever expect one.

I plan on publicly posting our 16 pages of official bylaws (the same ones filed with the IRS) as membership grows and we take on other board members.

### 4. Membership is fundamental 

The success and health of this foundation is built on **membership**.

Members decide where the money goes. The intellectual decision-making power of our members is the heart of the foundation.

We need quality, determined, committed, and empathetic members.

Because membership, voting, and awarding sponsorship will be dictated by members, members will need to be self organizing.

All membership work is to be 100% transparent and performed in public venues.

We have an **immediate need** for members! Please help us give our money to transgender minds in stem today.

### 5. We value diversity 

 > We need everyone.

Having a well-balanced breadth of people working with the foundation is our primary value. So yes -- we hope to have members from all classes of the world present.

Members will be responsible for drafting and maintaining the following items.

 - Code of Conduct
 - Diversity Statement

# What's next?

That's it. 

I carved out the legal space necessary to protect our members and give them the freedom to follow their hearts.

The foundation collects money. Members self organize and change transgender lives in STEM forever. 

I serve as a powerless entity that manages the paperwork and has veto capabilities.

We will be announcing **membership** as new members are elected. 

We will be announcing **sponsorships** as members award them.
